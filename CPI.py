"""
Description: This is the utility program that converts cost of living between \
two inputted cities in the U.S. based on data within the last 3 years.

The program has two main parts:
    
    1- Extracting the necessary data
    
    *Notes:
        This utility query API from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS):
        https://www.bls.gov/developers/home.htm 
        using "Series ID": https://www.bls.gov/help/hlpforma.htm#CU
        
        We are interested in the CPI data that is not seasonally adjusted \
        (more data), sampled/observed monthly, is more recent, and for all \
        items. The area code helps query the exact CPI for a specific area.
        
        In short, our "Series ID" format is 'CUUR%sSA0' % (areaCode).
        
        The BLS did not calculate CPI for all cities but grouped CPIs by \
        region division in the census (northeast, pacific, etc.). However, \
        some cities have their own CPI dataset, maybe because prices there \
        are significantly higher than other cities in the same state.
        
        For this utility, if the user input a city that has its own dataset,\
        the program will use that city's area code. If the user input a city \
        that does not have its own dataset or a city that does not exist,\
        the program default to the area code of the census region division \
        containing the state of the city.
        
        These are the area code: https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/cu/cu.area
        
        It is copied and pasted into a text document, called 'areacode_main.txt' \
        in the folder, which the program will use. We clean this text file \
        manually for easier text processing. Detailed notes on how it was edited \
        is included in 'areacode.txt'.
        
        To avoid manually creating a dictionary of census region divisions and \
        their corresponding states, the program will also use census.csv downloaded from GitHub
        https://github.com/cphalpert/census-regions/blob/master/us%20census%20bureau%20regions%20and%20divisions.csv
        

    2- Coding the input and comparison methods
    
    *Notes: The CPI is only one part of the "cost of living index." This index \
    is used in a simple formula of [(City B â€“ City A)/City A] x 100 to give \
    the change in cost of living. With the purpose of simplifying this program \
    for this class, we will assume the CPI is the cost of living index and\
    apply it to the formula.
