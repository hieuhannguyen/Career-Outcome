#  Career Outcome Program
## A collaborative final project for Python II

### Abstract




### Additional Notes
1.	What are the CSVs and text files?
-	2 years’ quarter-wise visa H1B visa data (LCA_Disclosure_Data_FYYYY_QN)
-	census.csv and areacode_main.txt: state-region-division master files which are referenced in the cost-of-living utility to match input city-state choice to extracted CPI data
-	areacode.txt: the full area code available to query with notes on how it was manually cleaned for the program

2.	What are the .py files not executed?
These files contain the codes for each menu option; all are imported to main.py.
Each of these files has explanatory comments. Summary overview below:
-	‘CPI.py’: Extracts CPI data, and matches user input to show cost-of-living comparison
-	‘HeinzReport.py’: Extracts Heinz career reports for career outcome analysis and summarization
-	‘careerReport.py’: Use H1B visa information and extracts employment projection data to present information relevant to user
